This is my assignment from data bootcamp 
# Wealth of Nations Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and data for my analysis of the Wealth of Nations dataset using Excel and Tableau.

## Overview

In this project, I explored the Wealth of Nations dataset to uncover insights into various economic and social indicators. I utilized both Excel and Tableau to analyze and visualize the data, providing a comprehensive understanding of key metrics such as GDP, smartphone usage, and life expectancy.

## Excel Analysis

In the initial phase of the project, I leveraged Excel to clean, filter, and sort the dataset. Additionally, I created various charts and visualizations to better understand the relationships between different variables. Furthermore, I implemented measures to protect the Excel file and ensure data integrity.

## Tableau Dashboard

Following the Excel analysis, I imported the cleaned dataset into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard consists of four visuals, focusing on key insights derived from the dataset:

1. GDP vs. Smartphone Users: A comparison of GDP against the number of smartphone users, showcasing any potential correlations or patterns.
2. Life Expectancy at Birth: Visualizing the life expectancy at birth across different nations, providing insights into the overall health and well-being of populations.
3. Smartphone Users: A breakdown of the number of smartphone users across nations, highlighting the adoption of technology.
4. [Fourth Visual Description]: [Brief description of the fourth visual, if necessary]

## How to Use

To replicate and explore the analysis:

1. [Download the Wealth of Nations dataset](link_to_dataset) and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Open the Excel file (`analysis.xlsx`) to view the cleaned dataset and visualizations.
3. [Download and install Tableau](tableau_download_link) if you haven't already.
4. Import the dataset into Tableau and open the Tableau workbook (`dashboard.twb`) to interact with the dashboard.
